# Earrings Folder

Add your earring images to this folder!

## Instructions:
1. Drop any earring image files here (PNG, JPG, JPEG, WEBP)
2. Name them whatever you want (e.g., `gold-hoops.png`, `diamond-studs.jpg`)
3. The app will automatically detect and load them

## Supported formats:
- `.png` (recommended for transparent backgrounds)
- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`
- `.webp`

The earrings will be automatically sized and positioned on the ears based on face detection.
